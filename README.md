# 3mtt-Devops

Welcome to the **3mtt-Devops** project!  
This repository serves as a practical DevOps project, covering the essential aspects of modern DevOps practices and tooling.

## Overview

This project demonstrates core DevOps concepts including:
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Configuration Management
- Containerization and Orchestration
- Monitoring and Logging
- Automation and Scripting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (for IaC)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) or similar tool (for configuration management)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (for scripting)
- Cloud provider CLI (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI, or GCP CLI), if deploying to the cloud

### Setup

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jjacobstech/3mtt-Devops.git
   cd 3mtt-Devops
   ```

2. **Review the documentation and folder structure** for various DevOps components.

3. **Set up environment variables** as required for your environment.

## Workflows

- **CI/CD:** Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines.
- **IaC:** Provision and manage infrastructure declaratively.
- **Config Management:** Maintain consistency across environments.
- **Containerization:** Build and deploy applications using Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Monitoring:** Collect, analyze, and visualize metrics and logs.
